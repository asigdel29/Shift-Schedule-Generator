The program reads data from an Excel file containing information on the availability of employees and creates a schedule based on that data. The program reads the availability data from the 'Availability' sheet and stores it in a dictionary. It then reads the schedule from the 'Schedule' sheet and stores the unfilled shifts in a list. The program sorts the list of unfilled shifts by the work hours of the employees and then assigns the shifts to the most suitable employees. Finally, the updated schedule is saved to the Excel file.
